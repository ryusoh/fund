## 1. Business Snapshot

### 1.1 What the company does

- Core business / segments:
    - Upstream oil & gas: exploration and production of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs, centered on the Permian Basin (Delaware & Midland), DJ Basin/Rockies, Gulf of Mexico, and select Middle East/North Africa assets.
    - Midstream & marketing: pipelines, gathering, processing, storage and marketing/trading that support upstream monetization, plus a significant stake in Western Midstream Partners (WES).
    - Low-carbon ventures (1PointFive): Direct Air Capture (DAC) plants and CO₂ sequestration hubs, selling carbon removal credits and enabling “net-zero oil.”

- Geography / customer concentration:
    - Key regions: U.S. onshore (Permian, DJ), Gulf of Mexico offshore, Oman/UAE/Algeria internationally.
    - Customer mix: diversified refiners, traders, and national oil companies; no single-customer concentration.

- Business model in one sentence:
    - OXY converts low-cost hydrocarbon reserves into free cash flow through efficient upstream operations and supporting midstream, while building a parallel carbon management business that monetizes CO₂ removals and decarbonized barrels.

### 1.2 Why this is in my universe

- Thesis type:
    - Cyclical / macro-levered value with turnaround elements and structural upside (carbon).

- My edge / variant perception vs market:
    - Market still anchors on “levered Anadarko bet / 2020 near-death experience” and treats OXY as a generic shale E&P, while I think:
        - The balance sheet is now structurally safer (debt trending below ~$15B, preferreds shrinking).
        - The upstream portfolio (Permian + Gulf) is better quality than the multiple implies.
        - The Low Carbon / DAC business is a real out-of-the-money call option that is mostly ignored in current pricing.
        - The Berkshire relationship adds a soft floor (deep-pocketed buyer, validation of management) that is not fully reflected in downside scenarios.

### 1.3 Current valuation snapshot

- Price: ~$42 per share
- Trailing EPS / PE: ~\$1.3–1.4 / ~30x (depressed earnings after oil pullback + noise)
- Forward EPS / forward PE: ~\$2.1–2.3 / ~18–20x (based on consensus mid-cycle oil assumptions)
- EV / EBITDA: ~5× (on normalized EBITDA)
- Market cap / EV: ~$41B / ~$63B
- 52-week range: roughly \$35 – \$53
- Volatility (used in model): ~28% annualized (1Y)

## 2. Business Quality & Moat

### 2.1 Moat / competitive advantage

- Sources of moat:
    - Low-cost resource base in the Permian and Gulf of Mexico (top-tier shale / deepwater barrels).
    - Long-standing CO₂ EOR expertise and CO₂ pipeline/injection infrastructure that competitors lack.
    - First mover in industrial-scale DAC and CO₂ sequestration with government backing and offtake contracts.
    - Scale, relationships, and access to capital (including Berkshire) that smaller E&Ps cannot replicate.

- Moat durability:
    - Geology and installed infrastructure provide durable low-cost advantage over 5–10 years.
    - DAC and sequestration require complex permitting, tech, and capex; OXY’s head start and partnerships (Airbus, United, etc.) create path dependence and learning-curve advantage.
    - Risks to moat: faster-than-expected demand decline for oil, DAC tech commoditization, or regulation shifting incentives away from OXY’s chosen pathways.

### 2.2 Unit economics & returns

- Unit / contract economics (conceptual):
    - At ~$70–75 WTI, core Permian and Gulf barrels generate high cash margins with short payback periods on new wells.
    - CO₂ EOR extends field lives, improving overall recovery and lowering F&D costs per barrel.
    - DAC unit economics are early but supported by 45Q tax credits and premium offtake contracts; not yet a major P&L driver but high option value.

- Returns on capital:
    - ROIC is highly oil-price sensitive; in mid-cycle environments, OXY can deliver mid-teens ROCE with leverage falling.
    - As interest and preferred dividends decline, ROE/ROIC should structurally improve for a given oil price.

- Cyclicality:
    - Strongly cyclical: volumes fairly stable, but realized prices and margins tied to global oil / gas prices.
    - Some diversification via geography and midstream/marketing, but still fundamentally a commodity producer, albeit toward the low end of the cost curve.

### 2.3 Management & capital allocation

- Management quality:
    - CEO Vicki Hollub: controversial but battle-tested; pursued Anadarko and CrownRock, then executed large-scale deleveraging and avoided bankruptcy in 2020.
    - Credibility strengthened by delivering on debt-reduction targets and attracting/retaining Berkshire as a long-term partner.

- Capital allocation:
    - Past: aggressive, big-bet M&A financed with debt and preferred equity.
    - Present: more disciplined playbook:
        - Hit explicit debt targets (principal down to low ~$20Bs, heading below $15B).
        - Monetize non-core assets (OxyChem sale, partial WES monetization).
        - Gradually rebuild dividend, then layer on buybacks as leverage falls.
        - Allocate growth capex primarily into highest-return upstream projects and select DAC investments.

- Alignment:
    - Insider ownership meaningful; Berkshire as ~25%+ owner is a quasi-“anchor LP” with very long horizon.
    - Incentives increasingly tied to FCF, leverage, and returns rather than pure volume growth.

## 3. Key Drivers & Risk Map

### 3.1 Core value drivers (next 5 years)

- Volume drivers:
    - Permian development (including CrownRock inventory) and Gulf of Mexico tie-backs.
    - Modest international growth / stability in Oman and UAE.
    - Targeted 1–3% annual production growth, depending on price and capex discipline.

- Price / mix:
    - Mid-cycle WTI assumption ~$70–75/bbl; key macro lever.
    - Associated gas and NGL pricing; upside if North American gas recovers from current lows.

- Margin drivers:
    - Operating leverage: higher prices lift margins disproportionately.
    - Efficiency and technology: longer laterals, faster drilling, digital optimization.
    - Financial leverage decline: reduced interest and preferred dividends lift net margins.

- Balance sheet:
    - Continued debt reduction; principal debt target < ~$15B.
    - Potential ratings upgrades cutting interest cost.
    - Ability to flex capex down in downturns to preserve balance sheet.

- Optionality:
    - DAC + sequestration turning into a real EBITDA contributor by late decade.
    - “Net-zero oil” premium and carbon removal contracts expanding.
    - Further asset monetization (WES or other non-core) used for buybacks / pref redemption.

### 3.2 Risk map and thesis killers

- Structural risks:
    - Faster-than-expected energy transition (EVs, efficiency, policy) leading to earlier peak and decline in oil demand.
    - Policy shifts undermining DAC economics (45Q changes, permitting delays).
    - Climate litigation or stricter regulations on drilling and methane.

- Financial risks:
    - Oil price shock downward (sustained <$50) leading to weak FCF, possible dividend cut, and stalled buybacks.
    - Potential for renewed M&A that re-levers the balance sheet.

- Governance / headline risks:
    - Another large acquisition perceived as value-destructive.
    - Environmental incidents, spills, or DAC failures generating negative headlines.

- Explicit thesis-kill triggers:
    - Reversal of capital allocation discipline: meaningful re-levering to fund M&A or non-core growth.
    - Policy changes that remove or severely weaken carbon capture incentives without a compensating business pivot.
    - Evidence that OXY’s structural cost position has degraded (persistent underperformance versus peers).
    - Multi-year oil demand declines not driven by a transient recession, accompanied by weak pricing.

## 4. Scenario Design – Fermat–Pascal Three States

This documents the mapping from qualitative thesis to `scenarios` JSON.

### 4.1 Shared baseline assumptions

- Starting EPS: ~\$1.3–1.4 (TTM)
- Starting PE: ~30x (on depressed trailing earnings)
- Time horizon: 5 years
- Balance sheet / share count:
    - Net/principal debt starts around low \$20Bs and drops below \$15B with the OxyChem sale and ongoing FCF.
    - Share count around ~980–1,000M now, trending toward ~850–900M via buybacks if mid-cycle pricing holds.
- Macro / regime assumptions (central case):
    - Real WTI mid-cycle ~$70–75/bbl.
    - No assumption of extreme super-cycle or Armageddon; those live in Bull/Bear.
- Macro vs company layers:
    - Macro: oil price band, global demand path, OPEC discipline.
    - Company: OXY’s execution, capex discipline, DAC ramp, capital return policy.

---

### 4.2 Bull Case – “Supercharged Cash Flows & Carbon Bonus”

- JSON mapping:
    - `prob`: 0.25
    - `growth.epsCagr`: 0.25
    - `valuation.exitPe`: 12

#### 4.2.1 Narrative (world description)

- Global oil demand remains strong; underinvestment leads to structural supply tightness.
- WTI averages ~$90/bbl+, with frequent periods above \$100.
- OPEC+ discipline holds; non-OPEC supply disappoints relative to demand growth.
- OXY’s production grows ~3% per year on core assets with very strong margins.
- DAC and CO₂ sequestration scale: Stratos and follow-on plants operate at high utilization with attractive long-term contracts.
- Market views OXY as both a premier low-cost oil producer and a credible carbon-removal platform.

#### 4.2.2 Key assumptions

- Revenue / volume:
    - Production ~1.46 Mboe/d → ~1.7 Mboe/d in 5 years.
    - Realized liquids prices track high WTI; gas/NGL modestly stronger too.
- Margin structure:
    - Operating margins expand meaningfully on high prices; unit costs held in check via scale and efficiency.
    - Interest expense sharply lower; preferred stock largely redeemed.
- Capital allocation:
    - Debt reduced to potentially < \$10B.
    - Aggressive buybacks retire 15–20% of shares.
    - Dividend grows to a 3–4% yield on a much higher stock price.
- Optionality realized:
    - DAC generates hundreds of millions in EBITDA; market assigns explicit “climate-tech” value to the platform.
    - Possibility of SOTP thinking and/or spin-like narratives.

#### 4.2.3 Why these numbers are reasonable

- EPS CAGR rationale (25%):
    - High oil prices + modest volume growth + interest savings + 15–20% share-count shrink can plausibly drive EPS from ~\$1.3 to \$9–10 in 5 years (~25% CAGR).
- Exit PE rationale (12x):
    - Slight premium to a pure E&P at the top of the cycle (which might trade 8–10x), justified by de-risked balance sheet and DAC optionality.
    - Still below market multiple, acknowledging cyclicality and oil exposure.

#### 4.2.4 Evidence & supporting material (Bull)

- Company:
    - 2022 results showed how much cash OXY prints at very high oil prices.
    - Management explicitly positioning DAC as a core future growth area.
- Industry / macro:
    - Ongoing concerns about underinvestment in upstream supply and declining spare capacity.
- My interpretation:
    - Not the most likely path but a realistic upside branch given history of oil cycles and OXY’s asset quality.

### 4.3 Base Case – “Deleveraged Cash Cow with Steady Returns”

- JSON mapping:
    - `prob`: 0.55
    - `growth.epsCagr`: 0.12
    - `valuation.exitPe`: 10

#### 4.3.1 Narrative (world description)

- “Nothing heroic” world: oil markets roughly balanced; no structural shortage or glut.
- WTI averages ~$70–75/bbl over 5 years; volatility but no permanent shift.
- OXY grows production modestly (~1–2% per year), focusing on high-return projects.
- DAC ramps slower; it’s strategically important but only a small P&L contributor by year 5.
- OXY completes deleveraging, returns increasing FCF via dividends and buybacks, and becomes a predictable cash-return story.

#### 4.3.2 Key assumptions

- Revenue / volume:
    - Production ~flat to +1–2% CAGR; no big surprises.
- Margin structure:
    - Margins roughly stable; mild operating leverage as interest shrink.
- Capital allocation:
    - Debt reduced to target (< \$15B) then held around that or slightly lower.
    - Steady buybacks retire ~3–4% of shares annually.
    - Dividend grows from ~2% yield today to maybe 3% on higher EPS.
- Optionality:
    - DAC breaks even to modestly profitable; main benefit is ESG halo and long-term option value, not near-term earnings.

#### 4.3.3 Why these numbers are reasonable

- EPS CAGR rationale (12%):
    - With mid-cycle oil, slight volume growth, shrinking interest, and a few percent share-count shrink, EPS can grow low double-digits without needing a super-cycle.
- Exit PE rationale (10x):
    - “Normal” through-the-cycle multiple for a de-levered, mid-cycle oil producer.
    - Slight discount to market P/E, reflecting commodity risk.

#### 4.3.4 Evidence & supporting material (Base)

- Company:
    - Current guidance and actions (debt reduction, OxyChem sale, repurchase program) point toward this steady-state model.
- Industry / macro:
    - Consensus mid-cycle oil assumptions cluster around ~$70–75.
- My interpretation:
    - This is my anchor scenario and what I assume the market is implicitly pricing close to today.

### 4.4 Bear Case – “Structural Headwinds & Stagnation”

- JSON mapping:
    - `prob`: 0.20
    - `growth.epsCagr`: -0.05
    - `valuation.exitPe`: 8

#### 4.4.1 Narrative (world description)

- Adverse but non-apocalyptic world:
    - Global oil demand disappoints due to faster EV penetration, efficiency, or policy-driven demand destruction.
    - WTI averages ~$50–55/bbl for several years.
- OXY cuts capex to preserve balance sheet; production stagnates or slowly declines.
- DAC under-delivers: tech or policy setbacks limit economics and scale.
- Market sees OXY as a “melting ice cube” oil producer with a carbon side-bet that hasn’t paid off.

#### 4.4.2 Key assumptions

- Revenue / volume:
    - Volumes flat to slightly down; OXY prioritizes balance sheet and dividend preservation over growth.
- Margin structure:
    - Margins compressed by lower prices and some operating cost stickiness.
- Capital allocation:
    - Debt still manageable, but shareholder returns are limited; buybacks paused or modest.
    - Dividend growth stalls; potential cut if prices are very low for long.
- Optionality:
    - DAC produces underwhelming returns or becomes a modest cash drain.

#### 4.4.3 Why these numbers are reasonable

- EPS CAGR rationale (-5%):
    - Lower oil prices and flat volumes push EPS down; even with lower interest, net income trends sideways or declines.
- Exit PE rationale (8x):
    - Depressed-cycle multiple for a structurally challenged, low-growth commodity name.
    - Reflects market skepticism on long-term oil demand and OXY’s ability to pivot.

#### 4.4.4 Evidence & supporting material (Bear)

- Company:
    - History of 2020 shows OXY’s sensitivity to low prices, though leverage is now much lower.
- Industry / macro:
    - IEA / policy scenarios increasingly emphasize accelerated transition risks.
- My interpretation:
    - Not my base expectation but a non-trivial tail; must be respected in sizing and risk management.

- Links / files:
    - `docs/thesis/OXY/OXY-bear-evidence.md`

#### 4.4.5 Tail risks beyond modeled Bear

- Extreme events not modeled in 5-year EPS/PE:
    - Nationalization / expropriation of key assets.
    - Major environmental disaster (spill, blowout) with huge fines.
    - Severe global recession or war that collapses demand and/or locks in low prices for a long time.
    - Radical policy (e.g., outright bans on certain hydrocarbon uses).

## 5. Quantitative Summary & Model Check

(These are “good enough” hand estimates consistent with §4; actual engine may refine.)

- Expected annualized return (CAGR): ~14–16% (probability-weighted across the three scenarios).
- Expected exit multiple: ~10–11× on mid-cycle earnings.
- Fair value range today: roughly \$55 – \$80 per share (depending on exact oil assumptions and DAC credit).

- Kelly outputs:
    - Full Kelly weight: ~20% of portfolio
    - Scaled Kelly weight (× kellyScale = 0.5): ~10%

### 5.1 Interpretation vs benchmark and hurdle

- Benchmark return: S&P 500 (~8%/yr).
- Target (hurdle) CAGR: 15%/yr.

- Commentary:
    - Expected CAGR slightly above or near the 15% hurdle, clearly above the S&P 500 benchmark.
    - This feels consistent with the qualitative picture: downside is real (oil + policy), but current valuation plus balance-sheet improvement give a favorable skew.
    - Market seems to price only a plain-vanilla mid-cycle oil story; DAC optionality and further de-leveraging are underpriced, especially relative to the bull scenario.

---

## 6. Position Sizing & Trading Plan

### 6.1 Position policy

- Target weight range:
    - Normal target: 4% – 8%
    - Max allowed (constraints): 10%
    - Model-justified max (scaled Kelly): ~10%

- Entry / add rules:
    - Add / top-up if:
        - Expected 5Y CAGR > 15% and price implies <10× normalized mid-cycle EPS.
        - Oil price panic or macro scare pushes OXY into the mid–low \$30s without a structural thesis break.
        - Company hits key milestones (debt < \$15B, pref reduction, DAC contracts) and market reaction is muted.

- Trim / exit rules:
    - Trim if:
        - Stock price implies >14–15× mid-cycle EPS with no clear structural change (e.g., no major DAC re-rating yet).
        - Position size drifts >10% of portfolio.
    - Consider exit / big trim if:
        - Expected CAGR drops < benchmark (e.g., <8–9%) due to price appreciation or increased risk.
        - Thesis-kill triggers in §3.2 occur.

### 6.2 Liquidity & execution

- Liquidity considerations:
    - Large-cap, high-volume NYSE name; easy to enter/exit in normal market conditions.
- Execution notes:
    - Use limit orders around VWAP.
    - Scale in/out over several days in volatile tape, especially during oil swings or macro headlines.
