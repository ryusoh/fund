## 1. Business Snapshot

### 1.1 What the company does

- Core business / segments:
    - U.S. Secure Services:
        - Operates and manages owned/leased correctional, detention and processing facilities
        - ~66% of revenue; main counterparties: ICE, USMS, state DOCs
    - GEO Care / Electronic Monitoring (BI Inc.):
        - Alternatives to Detention (ATD) and Intensive Supervision Appearance Program (ISAP) for ICE
        - GPS ankle monitors, smartphone apps, case management
        - ~13% of revenue, high incremental margins
    - Reentry Services:
        - Residential reentry centers, day reporting, rehabilitation programs
        - ~12% of revenue
    - International Services:
        - Facilities in Australia, South Africa, U.K. and elsewhere (~9% of revenue)
- Geography / customer concentration:
    - Predominantly U.S.
    - ICE (DHS) ≈ half of total revenue; top 3 customers are U.S. federal agencies
- Business model in one sentence:
    - Owns and operates secure facilities and monitoring programs for governments under long-term, fee-based contracts, earning recurring cash flows tied to detainee/inmate volume and program participants.

### 1.2 Why this is in my universe

- Thesis type:
    - Policy-levered / special situation / deleveraging + buyback story
- My edge / variant perception vs market:
    - Market overweights headline/ESG and DOJ-ban risk, underweights:
        - Asset value (Lawton sale validated high per-bed NAV)
        - Durability of ICE demand (detention + ATD backlog)
        - Balance sheet repair + buyback optionality after pivot away from REIT structure
    - Consensus sees GEO as “ex-growth, legislatively doomed”; I see a levered, cash-generative duopoly with path-dependent upside from immigration policy and capital allocation.

### 1.3 Current valuation snapshot

- Price: ~$15.22
- Trailing EPS / PE: ~$1.70 / ~9×
- Forward EPS / forward PE: ~1.35–1.40 / ~11×
- EV / EBITDA: ~5.5–6× (TTM)
- Market cap / EV: ~$2.1B / ~$3.5B
- 52-week range: roughly ~$11 – ~$21
- Volatility (used in model): high (mid-30s% annualized), based on 1Y price history

## 2. Business Quality & Moat

### 2.1 Moat / competitive advantage

- Sources of moat:
- Government relationships, accreditation, and long operating history
- Scale and network of facilities across multiple jurisdictions
- Specialized expertise in secure operations and compliance
- BI Inc. as incumbent nationwide ATD/ISAP tech + operations provider
- Moat durability:
- High regulatory and reputational barriers to entry make new competitors unlikely
- Duopoly with CoreCivic in U.S. private corrections / ICE detention
- Could be eroded by:
    - Adverse regulation (bans on private detention / monitoring)
    - Government insourcing of ATD technology or case management
    - Aggressive underpricing by niche EM competitors for future ISAP bids

### 2.2 Unit economics & returns

- Unit / contract economics (conceptual):
    - Facilities:
        - Revenue: per-diem per bed, often with minimum guarantees
        - High fixed costs (staff, security, maintenance); strong operating leverage as occupancy rises
        - Capex: upfront build/retrofit, then modest maintenance
    - ATD / BI:
        - Revenue: per-participant per day fees for tech + supervision
        - Variable hardware cost per device; high software/service margin
        - Low capex, high incremental ROIC
- Returns on capital:
    - Historically decent ROIC when fully utilized; returns depressed when occupancy falls or pricing is reset
    - Asset value (Lawton $312M sale at ~$120k/bed) suggests underlying returns on owned facilities are better than stock price implies
- Cyclicality:
    - Driven more by policy/immigration flows than macro GDP
    - Some exposure to wage inflation (guards, staff) and interest rates (levered balance sheet)

### 2.3 Management & capital allocation

- Management quality:
    - Long-tenured leadership with deep relationships in corrections/immigration agencies
    - Historically over-relied on REIT structure + high payout; recent pivot toward deleveraging and share repurchases is positive
- Capital allocation:
    - Current focus:
        - Debt reduction (net debt down to ~2.0–2.5× EBITDA path)
        - Opportunistic asset sales at high multiples (Lawton sale)
        - New $300M then expanded $500M buyback authorization
    - No large, risky M&A in current plan (good)
- Alignment:
    - Insiders own a meaningful but not huge stake (~4%)
    - Governance ESG-overhang limits some investor base but also keeps valuations low

---

## 3. Key Drivers & Risk Map

### 3.1 Core value drivers (next 3 years)

- Volume drivers:
    - ICE detention population (beds filled vs funded capacity)
    - ATD / ISAP enrollment (participants under BI monitoring)
    - New facility contracts (e.g., Delaney Hall NJ, North Lake MI, Florida JV)
    - State DOC overcrowding and outsourcing decisions
- Price / mix:
    - Per-diem rates on facility contracts (inflation escalators, renewals)
    - ISAP pricing and mix shift toward higher-intensity GPS vs app-only
    - Shift toward higher-margin services (monitoring, reentry)
- Margin drivers:
    - Occupancy and utilization (spreading fixed costs)
    - Wage inflation vs contractual escalators
    - Efficiency in staffing and tech usage
    - Lower interest expense from deleveraging
- Balance sheet:
    - Execution of asset sales (Lawton-like deals) and debt paydown
    - Refinancing terms for 2026–27 maturities vs current spreads
    - Pace and size of buybacks vs debt reduction
- Optionality:
    - Policy pivot that expands private detention or ATD use
    - Additional high-multiple asset monetizations
    - Possible expansion into new geographies or adjacent government services

### 3.2 Risk map and thesis killers

- Structural risks:
    - Adverse regulation:
        - Federal ban on private detention (beyond DOJ), or forced wind-down of ICE private facilities
        - Large cuts to ATD funding / shift to NGO-run case management that bypasses BI
    - Political / ESG risk leading to contract non-renewals
    - Overreliance on ICE as a single customer
- Financial risks:
    - ~$3.5B EV with ~$1.6–1.7B gross debt; refinancing risk if spreads blow out
    - High fixed-cost base → sharp deleveraging of earnings when utilization drops
    - Potential need for equity issuance in a severe stress scenario
- Governance / headline risks:
    - Safety incidents, riots, abuse allegations, or litigation that cause facility closures or costly settlements
    - Negative court decisions on pay practices, conditions, or state bans (e.g., CA)
    - Bad headlines hurting contract renewals and investor base
- Explicit thesis-kill triggers:
    - Loss or non-renewal of ISAP contract to a competitor or in-house solution
    - Major ICE/state facility contract termination without replacement
    - Legislative enactment of broad bans on private detention/monitoring
    - Net debt/EBITDA rising instead of falling over the next 2–3 years

## 4. Scenario Design – Fermat–Pascal Three States

This section documents how I choose the JSON `scenarios` block and why.

### 4.1 Shared baseline assumptions

- Starting EPS: ~$1.70 (TTM)
- Starting PE: ~9×
- Time horizon: 3 years
- Balance sheet / share count:
    - Net debt ≈ $1.5–1.6B, trending down via FCF and asset sales
    - Share count ≈ 137M; assume modest net reduction (~10–15%) via buybacks over 3 years
- Macro / regime assumptions (if relevant):
    - Interest rates stay elevated but not spiking; refinancing at mid-single to high-single digit coupons
    - U.S. remains politically polarized; immigration stays a hot issue driving continued need for detention/ATD
    - No deep global recession that forces large budget cuts to DHS/ICE
- For macro-linked names (optional split):
    - Macro layer:
        - “Policy band” where private detention remains allowed but debated; ICE funding roughly stable to mildly up
    - Company layer:
        - GEO executes on deleveraging + buybacks; wins a few incremental contracts; avoids major scandals

---

### 4.2 Bull Case – “Policy Tailwind + Full Utilization”

- JSON mapping:
    - `prob`: 0.30
    - `growth.epsCagr`: 0.28
    - `valuation.exitPe`: 16

#### 4.2.1 Narrative (world description)

- Enforcement-focused federal administration and/or Congress:
    - Higher funded ICE detention capacity; private facilities heavily utilized
    - ATD/ISAP maintained or slightly expanded as court backlog persists
- New GEO contracts (Delaney, North Lake, FL) ramp smoothly; 1–2 additional significant contracts signed
- Facility occupancy moves closer to “full” across portfolio; minimal idle beds
- Wage inflation manageable and largely offset by per-diem escalators
- Net debt driven below ~$1.2B; buybacks retire 15–20% of shares

#### 4.2.2 Key assumptions

- Revenue / volume:
    - Mid-single to high-single digit revenue CAGR (more beds filled + stable to slightly higher ATD)
    - New contracts add incremental $150–200M/year revenue
- Margin structure:
    - EBITDA margin expands via operating leverage and mix
    - Interest expense falls with lower net debt
- Capital allocation:
    - Aggressive deleveraging for first 1–2 years, then balanced debt paydown + repurchases
    - No large, value-destructive acquisitions
- Optionality realized:
    - One or more policy surprises on enforcement/detention that meaningfully boost volumes
    - Asset sales at rich per-bed values used to retire expensive debt

#### 4.2.3 Why these numbers are reasonable

- EPS CAGR rationale (28%):
    - Revenue +6–8%/yr, EBITDA margin +150–250 bps, interest –20–30% over 3 years, share count –15–20%
    - Combined → EPS ~doubles (≈$1.7 → ~$2.0–2.2), which is ~25–30% CAGR
- Exit PE rationale (16×):
    - Still below historical peaks and peers in “good times”
    - Reflects a re-rating toward “normal value stock” but not full market multiple, acknowledging ESG hair

#### 4.2.4 Evidence & supporting material (Bull)

- Company:
    - New long-term ICE/state contracts announced (Delaney, North Lake, Florida)
    - Lawton sale confirms high asset value and capital flexibility
    - Buyback authorization ($300M then $500M)
- Industry / macro:
    - Large immigration court backlog, persistent enforcement needs
    - Political rhetoric favoring stricter border control and detention
- My interpretation:
    - Market is pricing GEO closer to “stagnation” while recent actions (asset sales, contracts, buybacks) support a path to higher utilization and EPS growth

### 4.3 Base Case – “Slow Grind, No Regime Change”

- JSON mapping:
    - `prob`: 0.50
    - `growth.epsCagr`: 0.12
    - `valuation.exitPe`: 11

#### 4.3.1 Narrative (world description)

- Policy environment stays messy but not extreme:
    - ICE detention and ATD fluctuate around current levels
    - No broad bans or large expansions; status quo plus incremental tweaks
- New contracts mostly offset contract expirations and Lawton revenue loss
- GEO slowly deleverages and modestly buys back shares
- Market remains skeptical; ESG headwinds persist; low-teens PE is ceiling

#### 4.3.2 Key assumptions

- Revenue / volume:
    - Low-single digit revenue CAGR (1–3%)
    - Some growth from new contracts offset by modest declines elsewhere
- Margin structure:
    - EBITDA margin roughly flat; minor efficiency gains offset by wage pressure
- Capital allocation:
    - Deleveraging prioritized; buybacks executed opportunistically but not fully
    - Dividend possibly reinstated late in horizon, but at low payout
- Optionality:
    - Most “options” (e.g. big policy tailwind) do not fully materialize; upside remains hypothetical

#### 4.3.3 Why these numbers are reasonable

- EPS CAGR rationale (12%):
    - Revenue ~2% CAGR, flat margins, interest savings 5–8% per year, share count –10% in total
    - Yields ~10–12% EPS CAGR starting from depressed base
- Exit PE rationale (11×):
    - Slight discount to market given political/ESG risk, slight premium to deep-distressed multiples
    - Aligns with mid-cycle EV/EBITDA multiples vs peers

#### 4.3.4 Evidence & supporting material (Base)

- Company:
    - Historical pattern of relatively stable revenues and modest contract churn
    - Guidance ranges consistent with low-growth but steady cash generation
- Industry / macro:
    - ICE/ATD budgets reflecting continuing but not explosive growth
    - No strong legislative consensus to either abolish or massively expand private detention
- My interpretation:
    - Base is “messy middle”: enough contracts to support cash flow, but not enough regime change to drive re-rating

### 4.4 Bear Case – “Policy Crackdown & Program Retrenchment”

- JSON mapping:
    - `prob`: 0.20
    - `growth.epsCagr`: -0.03
    - `valuation.exitPe`: 7

#### 4.4.1 Narrative (world description)

- Adverse but plausible environment:
    - Further tightening of DOJ/private-prison bans, political campaigns against ICE/private detention
    - Significant cuts to ATD funding and/or replacement of ISAP with NGO-led, less monitored programs
- GEO loses some major contracts or sees large utilization declines
- Deleveraging stalls; refinancing comes at high cost; equity perceived as “option on survival”

#### 4.4.2 Key assumptions

- Revenue / volume:
    - Revenue declines ~3–5%/yr as facilities/ATD shrink
    - Several facilities run at low occupancy or close
- Margin structure:
    - Margin compression from underutilization and fixed cost drag
    - Wage inflation not fully compensated
- Capital allocation:
    - Little room for buybacks; focus shifts to survival and debt servicing
    - Possible equity raise if credit markets tighten further

#### 4.4.3 Why these numbers are reasonable

- EPS CAGR rationale (-3%):
    - Declining revenue, lower margins, limited interest savings; EPS drifts down toward $0.7–0.8
- Exit PE rationale (7×):
    - Reflects high perceived probability of further structural decline
    - In line with distressed/regulatory-risk peers

#### 4.4.4 Evidence & supporting material (Bear)

- Company:
    - Recent steep drop in monitoring revenues when ICE reduced ATD enrollment
    - Historical contract losses tied to policy shifts (e.g., DOJ ban)
- Industry / macro:
    - Ongoing activist and political campaigns against private prisons and electronic monitoring
    - States like CA/OK taking steps to exit private facilities
- My interpretation:
    - While not my base view, policy knife cuts both ways; tail risk is real and needs explicit modeling

- Links / files:
    - docs/thesis/GEO/GEO-bear-evidence.md

#### 4.4.5 Tail risks beyond modeled Bear

- Federal or state-level outright ban on private detention/monitoring with minimal compensation
- Major scandal leading to multi-facility shutdowns or large punitive damages
- Severe credit market freeze coinciding with major contract losses (refinancing at punitive terms)

## 5. Quantitative Summary & Model Check

(Usually filled after running the engine and writing back to `derived` in JSON.)

- Expected annualized return (CAGR): ~18–20% (prob-weighted)
- Expected exit multiple: ~12× PE
- Fair value range today: roughly $15–25/share (midpoint ~$20–22)

- Kelly outputs:
    - Full Kelly weight: ~15%
    - Scaled Kelly weight (× kellyScale=0.5): ~7.5%

### 5.1 Interpretation vs benchmark and hurdle

- Benchmark return: S&P 500 ~8–10%/yr
- Target (hurdle) CAGR: 30%/yr

- Commentary:
    - Expected CAGR comfortably above benchmark, but shy of 30% hurdle unless Bull probability rises
    - Distribution is positively skewed: upside in Bull (>2×) significantly larger than downside in Bear (~–50%)
    - Market currently pricing something between Base and Bear; if reality trends toward Base/Bull, stock is undervalued

---

## 6. Position Sizing & Trading Plan

### 6.1 Position policy

- Target weight range:
    - Normal target: 1–3% of portfolio
    - Max allowed (constraints): 5%
    - Model-justified max (scaled Kelly): ~7.5% (but capped at 5% for governance/ESG/policy risk)
- Entry / add rules:
    - Add/rebuild position when:
        - Implied 3Y expected CAGR > 20%
        - Price < ~$18 **and**:
            - No thesis-kill policy events
            - Deleveraging on track (net debt/EBITDA not rising)
    - Size additions more aggressively on:
        - Clear positive policy signals (e.g., expanded ICE funding) without commensurate price reaction
- Trim / exit rules:
    - Trim when:
        - Price reaches ~$30–35 without clear evidence of Bull world (multiple >16× on stagnant EPS)
        - Expected 3Y CAGR < 10% vs benchmark ~8–10%
    - Exit or materially cut on:
        - Loss of ISAP or large ICE/state contracts
        - Legislative enactment of sweeping private detention bans
        - Evidence of sustained governance/operational breakdown

### 6.2 Liquidity & execution

- Liquidity considerations:
    - Mid-cap with adequate daily volume for 1–5% position; but avoid becoming forced seller in volatility
- Execution notes:
    - Prefer limit orders; add on down days or post-headline selloffs
    - Avoid chasing intraday spikes on policy rumors

---

## 7. Monitoring Checklist

### 7.1 Key metrics to track

- Business KPIs:
    - ICE detention population and funded bed capacity
    - ATD/ISAP enrollment counts and program funding levels
    - Facility occupancy rates; number and size of contract wins/losses
    - Segment revenue breakdown (Secure Services vs BI/EM vs Reentry)
- Financials:
    - Revenue growth by segment
    - EBITDA margin; operating and net margins
    - Free cash flow; capex; net debt/EBITDA
    - Interest expense and upcoming debt maturities
- Qualitative:
    - Policy statements from DHS/ICE, DOJ, state DOCs
    - Election outcomes and party positions on private prisons/ATD
    - Major investigations, litigation, or controversies involving GEO or peers
    - Competitor actions (CoreCivic, EM vendors) and pricing

### 7.2 Scenario update triggers

- Signals toward Bull:
    - ICE detention/ATD numbers trend meaningfully higher for several quarters
    - New large, multi-year contracts (federal or big states) awarded to GEO
    - Accelerated deleveraging + material buyback execution
    - Political developments favoring stricter enforcement and use of private providers
- Signals toward Bear:
    - Major contract losses (ISAP, large ICE facility, big state DOC)
    - Significant ATD funding cuts or shift to NGO-based models excluding BI
    - New federal/state bans targeting private detention/monitoring
    - Worsening legal/regulatory environment or large adverse judgments
- Signals we remain in Base:
    - Stable ICE/ATD numbers, some contract churn but overall flat revenue
    - Gradual debt reduction, muted but positive FCF
    - No decisive policy moves in either direction

---

## 9. Open Questions / Research To-Do

- Unresolved uncertainties:
    - How durable is ATD/ISAP structurally vs case-management/NGO alternatives?
    - What is the realistic long-term mix between detention vs ATD under different political regimes?
    - How aggressive will competition be in future ISAP rebids?
    - How many additional facilities could be monetized at Lawton-like valuations?
- Planned research:
    - Read ICE/DHS budget justifications and long-term enforcement plans
    - Track CoreCivic’s disclosures to compare positioning and risk
    - Follow legal status of state-level bans (e.g., CA AB32) and implications for GEO’s assets
    - Listen to future GEO earnings calls and conferences for color on ISAP economics and contract pipeline
